 **Assumptions**
1. A round of trivia has 10 Questions
2. All questions are multiple-choice questions
3. Your score does not need to update in real time
4. Results can update on form submit, button click, or any interaction you choose
5. We will provide you with the trivia data such as the questions, correct and incorrect answers via a JSON file.

 **Acceptance Criteria**
1. A user can view questions.
2. Questions with their multiple choice options must be displayed one at a time. 
3. Questions should not repeat in a round.
4. A user can select only 1 answer out of the 4 possible answers.
5. The correct answer must be revealed after a user has submitted their answer A user can see the score they received at the end of the round

* **What I would Improve/Next steps**
1. I would've liked to not use an alert to display the correct answer. 
2. There is a few sections where I could've refractor my code to be easier to read.
3. There should be instructions on how to play the game/ more info about the goal of the project would've been a better experience.
4. I wish I started earlier,so I could've spend more time on css/ creating a more cohesive brand.
5. As for next steps, I could create a page to show high scores or a section to learn more about the answers.
